# 🧠 AI-Powered Image Analysis Using Python

This project showcases an **AI-driven image analysis system** built using Python and popular deep learning libraries. The application is capable of performing object detection and classification on images using pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## 🚀 Features

* 🔍 Analyze and classify images with high accuracy
* 🖼️ Detect multiple objects in an image using pretrained models like VGG, ResNet, or MobileNet
* 🧠 Built with TensorFlow / Keras / PyTorch (based on implementation)
* 📊 Visualize predictions with bounding boxes and confidence scores
* 📁 Simple file input and output system for batch analysis

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python 3.x**
* **TensorFlow / Keras / PyTorch**
* **OpenCV** – image processing
* **Matplotlib** – result visualization
* **NumPy & Pandas** – data handling
